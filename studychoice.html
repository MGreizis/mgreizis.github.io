                <b><p>I have always been fascinated by computers. I spend a lot of my free time on the computer, whether it be playing video games, listening to music or watching videos on YouTube. Since ICT is part of everyone's future, my long-term goal in the ICT field is to help create a piece of software that helps people do their job easier. I like to call myself a "people-pleaser" so pretty much any project would work, as long as the outcome is that it helps people in their day-to-day work activities.</p></b>
                <b><p>After completing the study at HZ, I will want to be working in an ICT company as a Software Developer (I am definitely pursuing the Software Engineering study track in Year 3). I'm not sure if I will be living in The Netherlands after graduation, but I do know that I will be part of the ICT industry in one way or another. During the study I expect to learn how to code, how to be a team-oriented programmer and person in general.</p></b>
                <b><p>To prepare for this ICT program, I have taken some preliminary steps. From where I come from, Latvia, we have a day called <i>"Shadow Day"</i>. It usually takes place around Valentine's Day. On this day every high school student gets to choose a company and profession to "shadow" for the day. The students see what a day-to-day life looks like in their chosen industry. Twice I went on my Shadow Day to a company called <i>Accenture</i> and once I went to the <i>Latvian Bank</i>. Along with this, I also had an internship at a company in Latvia this summer.</p></b>
                <b><p>Along with what I previously mentioned - the Shadow Day and internship, I was also at HZ's Open Day in November 2019. As "proof" of that, you can see the picture I took of the Vlissingen HZ campus from far away on my <a href="index.html" class="mainlinks">home page</a></p></b>
