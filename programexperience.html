          <b><p>Prior to starting my studies in this ICT program, I have had a really small bit of experience from when I was in high school. We had one semester to learn a bit of HTML and CSS. JavaScript was also planned but because of COVID-19 that didn't happen. I can't say I learned all that much because the teacher wasn't all that great. Outside of what experience I had in high school, I took one course on Web Development Basics, where I just dove a bit deeper into HTML. So, in summary, I had a small bit of experience prior to starting this program but not enough to really stand out.</p></b>
