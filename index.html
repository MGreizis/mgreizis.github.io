       I think I'm supposed to convince everybody listening to me at this moment why I think that ICT is for me, which shouldn't be hard.
     </p></b>

      <b><p>
        I've been around computers all my life, I've been playing video games since I was about 6 years old, so I've had my fair share of experiences - both good and bad. This summer I had the opportunity to have an internship at a <a href="https://www.aepartner.dk/" class="mainlinks">company</a> in Latvia, hence the picture. My goal as an intern there was to collect User Stories from other employees because the company was migrating to different IT systems. 
      </p></b>

      <b><p>
        My long-term goal in the ICT field is to help create a piece of software that helps people do their job easier. Whether it be working on an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) System or whatever else it may be. I know that in my third year here, I will definitely be pursuing the Software Engineer study track.

        At this point I could lie and say that I've known all my life that I'll be studying IT after graduating from high school but that is not quite the case. I made up my mind fully after my brother graduated from university after studying IT aswell. When he told me his experiences in university and how exciting it was studying IT, I knew that I will also go down the same path as him. And a couple of years later, I am here - starting my studies at <a href="https://hz.nl/en/study-programmes/it" class="mainlinks">HZ University of Applied Sciences</a>.
